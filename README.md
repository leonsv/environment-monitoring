The aim of the project is to use an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to monitor and gather environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. 
The collected data will be processed and visualized using Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming tool, to create a real-time monitoring system. 
This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Arduino Uno and Node-RED in environmental monitoring applications and provide a foundation for further exploration and development in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based environmental monitoring.
